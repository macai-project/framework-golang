# framework-golang

This is the base framework for every lambda function that react to events.

It MUST NOT contain business logic.

The framework will provide all of the tools needed to build lambdas in the correct way, ex:

* logger
* database connection
* xray

To see how to use this repository look at the skeleton-golang repository.
